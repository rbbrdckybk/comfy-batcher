# Example Comfy-Batcher mapping file
# Use the following syntax to define mappings between the associated ComfyUI JSON workflow file and Comfy-Batcher:
# 	[Comfy-Batcher argument] == [node title in JSON workflow]/path/location/of/variable/to/set
# See examples below that correspond to the example 'flux_workflow_api.json' file.
# Note that 'prompt' must ALWAYS be defined; this is where the prompts from your prompt file will be inserted!
# Other than prompt, you only need to map items that you want to be able to access via command-line arguments.
# You may define 1:N relationships by listing multiple nodes on the right side of the '==' (separate with a comma)
